#### 🎯 AutoTLS: Automatic Certificates for libp2p WebSockets via `libp2p.direct`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51af045b-eff7-414f-b52b-0d1f222d74a3" width="300px" />

This release introduces an experimental feature that significantly improves how browsers ([Helia](https://helia.io/), [Service Worker](https://inbrowser.link)) can connect to Kubo node.

Opt-in configuration allows a publicly dialable Kubo nodes (public IP, port forwarding, or NAT with uPnP) to obtain CA-signed TLS certificates for [libp2p Secure WebSocket (WSS)](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/websockets/README.md) connections automatically.

> [!TIP]
> To enable this feature, set `AutoTLS.Enabled` to `true` and add a listener for `/tls/sni/*.libp2p.direct/ws` on a separate TCP port:
> ```diff
> {
> + "AutoTLS": { "Enabled": true },
>   "Addresses": {
>     "Swarm": {
>       "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4001",
> +     "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4002/tls/sni/*.libp2p.direct/ws",
>       "/ip6/::/tcp/4001",
> +     "/ip6/::/tcp/4002/tls/sni/*.libp2p.direct/ws",
> ```
> After restarting your node for the first time you may need to wait 5-15 minutes to pass all checks and for the changes to take effect.
> We are working on sharing the same TCP port with other transports ([go-libp2p#2984](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/pull/2984)).

See [`AutoTLS` configuration](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#autotls) for more details how to enable it and what to expect.

This is an early preview, we appreciate you testing and filling bug reports or feedback in the tracking issue at [kubo#10560](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/10560).
